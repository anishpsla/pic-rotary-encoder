{"name":"Pic-rotary-encoder","tagline":"Rotary Encoder for PIC using MikroC C compiler","body":"### Welcome MikroC PIC Rotary Encoder page.\r\nThis is my first project hosted on GitHub.\r\n\r\nA rotary encoder, also called a shaft encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to an analog or digital code (Wikipedia). Rotary encoders are widely used in many places in many form. It will be used as Volume control in Car stereos and other electronic equipment.\r\n\r\nThere are many Rotary Encoder code snippets are available for PIC Microcontroller using MikroC. Most are bulky and hard to understand. In an environment like Microcontroller, the resources are very low and the code should be highly optimized for performance. The code is ported from Arduino code found on a Youtube video. \r\n\r\nThe code is very simple and self well commented. The code is written for PIC16F877A. The code can be used with any PIC Microcontroller having external interrupt pin.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-51310436-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
