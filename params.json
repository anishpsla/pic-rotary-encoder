{"name":"Pic-rotary-encoder","tagline":"Rotary Encoder for PIC using MikroC C compiler","body":"### Welcome MikroC PIC Rotary Encoder page.\r\nThis is my first project hosted on GitHub.\r\n\r\nA rotary encoder, also called a shaft encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to an analog or digital code (Wikipedia). Rotary encoders are widely used in many places in many form. It will be used as Volume control in Car stereos and other electronic equipment.\r\n\r\nThere are many Rotary Encoder code snippets are available for PIC Microcontroller using MikroC. Most are bulky and hard to understand. In an environment like Microcontroller, the resources are very low and the code should be highly optimized for performance. The code is ported from Arduino code found on a Youtube video. \r\n\r\nThe code is very simple and self well commented. The code is written for PIC16F877A. The code can be used with any PIC Microcontroller having external interrupt pin.","google":"UA-51310436-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
